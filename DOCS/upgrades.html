<LI>To configure your server for the central Dedimania
database, you must copy the login value in the
<CODE>&lt;masterserver_account&gt;</CODE> section from
your server's dedicated_cfg.txt file into the corresponding
section of the dedimania.xml file.  Further, <A TARGET="_blank"
HREF="http://dedimania.net/tm2stats/?do=register">register your
server</A> with the Dedimania system, generate a DedimaniaCode,
and add that in dedimania.xml as well.
<LI>Open port <b>8082</b> on your firewall/router for communication
with the central Dedimania server.
<LI>In the zip file, all *.XML and *.PHP config files are located
inside the <b>newinstall/</b> directory.  This means that you can (and
have to) unzip the download and replace all the PHP code files, without
worrying about overwriting your customized config files.  However, for
every XML/PHP config file that was updated (see above), you <u>must</u>
replace your version with the one from the newinstall/ directory, or
compare them and <u>add</u> any new/changed configuration settings
to your version to insure the system remains working correctly.
<LI>For a new installation, go into the newinstall/ directory and move
all *.XML files into the main directory (next to xaseco2.php), all
*.PHP files into the includes/ directory, and XAseco2.bat|XAseco2.sh
also into the main directory.
</UL>
<br>

<LI><u>Upgrading from v0.93 to v0.95</u>:<br><br>

includes/basic.inc.php, manialinks.inc.php, rasp.settings.php,
